# Libft

The libft is the first project of [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/)'s common core. It is a collection of C functions, supposed to serve as a foundation for other projects, and it aims to replace functions of C's standard library.

Once the libft has been evaluated, students are free to customize it will, as long as they follow the [Norme](https://github.com/42School/norminette). This is my own personnal, customized libft, meant to be used in 42's projects.

Of course, as it is public, you're free to take inspiration or use it in your own projects. Although if you plan to have it in your own 42 projects, be sure to understand everything you're using. In an evaluation, you should be able to explain properly the intrinsics of your code.

## Features

- Dynamic strings (and many functions to manipulate them, inspired from python's API)
- Bounding functions for all primitive types (min, max, abs, clamp)
- Memory manipulation (memset, memcopy...)
- Float manipulaton (fmod, trunc...) with support for high precision floats (80 bits and 128 bits)
- Printing of all primitive types, as well as complex numbers
- Char checking (is_upper...)

## Planned / Ongoing

- Dynamic vector type
- Parsing
- A proper printf (right now the custom printf is very limited)

## Documentation

None for now. The docs folder is outdated, and doesn't provide much anyways.
